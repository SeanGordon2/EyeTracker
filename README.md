# EyeTracker

This project aims to detect an individual's facial features, and to assess their eye and pupil movement. This 
functionality should allow for determination of pupil size (to assess anisocoria, miosis, mydriasis, etc.) and eye 
movements.

### Tasks to Complete
1. Eyelid Detection and Monitoring
2. Pupil Tracker (Size and Reactivity)
3. Movement Tracker (Saccades and Nystagmus)
